# Data Structures and Algorithms

This is the my entire code of the course :-\
"Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++"\
by Abdul Bari Sir.



## Note

1]I have used "Microsoft Visual Studio Code 2019" instead of "VS code", 
due to some technical issue back then, so file structure is little 
complicated.\
2] To view the code of a particular file you need to follow path
which looks like :- Graphs/Prims_Program/Prims_Program/Prims_Program.cpp  
3] Avoid cloning this repo, as it is huge in size. Instead you can 
refer it here itself.
